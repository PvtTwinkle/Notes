# Notes
Notes I have taken related to IT skills, courses, certifications, etc. 

Purpose: 
1. Have record of notes that can easily be pulled/accessed anywhere.
2. Practice using git, github, markdown, etc.
3. Share notes with others who may find them useful when studying for their own certifications
4. Showcase knowledge, skills, and documentation process for potential employers.
